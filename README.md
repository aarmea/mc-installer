# MC-INSTALLER

[![Snap Status](https://build.snapcraft.io/badge/kz6fittycent/snap-minecraft.svg)](https://build.snapcraft.io/user/kz6fittycent/snap-minecraft)

# Installation
`sudo snap install mc-installer --edge`

# About
A fork of the Minecraft-NSG installer snap. Omits the Oracle version of Java and just runs with openjdk. Skips the dialog and just downloads the .jar and runs the installer.

This does not come WITH Minecraft pre-installed. It simply downloads the .jar and allows you to play it on you Linux box. Preferably a superior distribution that is capable of running `snapd`. 

Enjoy!
